#api.t-fk.opengov

API for the opengov.cloudapp.net solution from Software Innovation.

This is developed for http://opengov.cloudapp.net/Meetings/tfk/ but by changing PATH in config.js it will probably work for all installations.

##Usage

Clone from GitHub or download source code.

cd into local directory and install dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

Start the server

```
$ npm start
```

##Disclaimer

This is not an official API form Software Innovation.

It will probably break the second they update their solution.

Until then, this is good enough ;-)

##Todo

Documentation with jsdoc
